# Java

1. In Java everything is Object which has some data and behavior. java.lang.Object is the base class of all classes. Java uses primitive data types and hence is not a pure object oriented language.
2. Java code is guaranteed to be written once, run anywhere. On compilation, Java program is compiled into bytecode. The bytecode is platform independent and can run on any machine.

{% hint style="info" %}
JDK is Java Development Kit which is for development purpose and it includes execution environment also. But JVM is purely a run time environment and hence you will not be able to compile your source files using a JVM.
