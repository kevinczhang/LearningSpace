# Object-Oriented programming



* _Encapsulation_ means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
* _Inheritance_ describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class.
* _Polymorphism_ means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
