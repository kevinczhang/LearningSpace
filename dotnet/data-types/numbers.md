# Numbers

Numbers, in general, can be divided into two types: Integer type and floating-point types.

**Integer type** numbers are whole numbers without decimal points. It can be negative or positive numbers.

**Floating-point type** is numbers with one or more decimal points. It can be negative or positive numbers.

## Integral Types

sbyte \(8\), byte \(8\), short \(16\), ushort \(16\), int \(32\), uint \(32\), long \(64\), ulong \(64\)

For unsigned numbers, the range is from 0 to 2N-1, and signed numbers range is from -2N-1 to 2N-1-1.

 Letter `u` in front of the type means that type canâ€™t contain negative numbers, it is unsigned.
