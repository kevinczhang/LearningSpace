### Hoisting

Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope.

###  **Closure**

When a function returns the other function the returning function will hold its environment and this is known as closure.

 **Polyfilling**

It is one of the methodologies that can be used as a sort of backward compatibility measurement.

 **Transpiling**

**A** tool that transforms code with newer syntax into older code equivalents and this process is called “Transpiling”.
