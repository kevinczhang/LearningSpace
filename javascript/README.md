# Javascript

## JavaScript HTML DOM \(Document Object Model\)

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel of the page. With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

The **HTML DOM** model is constructed as a tree of **Objects**:

Window object

The window object represents a window in browser. An object of window is created automatically by the browser. Window is the object of browser, it is not the object of javascript. The javascript objects are string, array, date etc.
