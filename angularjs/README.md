# AngularJS

AngularJS is an open-source, JavaScript-based, front-end web application framework for dynamic web app development. It utilizes HTML as a template language. By extending HTML attributes with directives and binding data to HTML with expressions, AngularJS creates an environment that is readable, extraordinarily expressive and quick to develop.

AngularJS is a **JavaScript framework**. It can be added to an HTML page with a &lt;script&gt; tag.

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with **Directives**, and binds data to HTML with **Expressions**.

## AngularJS Extends HTML

AngularJS extends HTML with **ng-directives**.

The **ng-app** directive defines an AngularJS application.

The **ng-model** directive binds the value of HTML controls \(input, select, textarea\) to application data.

The **ng-bind** directive binds application data to the HTML view.
